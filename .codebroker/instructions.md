# CodeBroker MCP Server — Repository Intelligence Layer

You are connected to the **CodeBroker MCP Server**.

CodeBroker is the primary repository intelligence, discovery, architecture, and context engine for the active workspace.

Your native tools are still available, but they should NOT be your first choice for understanding the codebase.

---

# Available Tools

You MUST only use the following listed deterministic tools for the CodeBroker MCP Server:
- set_workspace
- reindex_workspace
- subsystem_communication
- architectural_hotspots
- dependency_cycles
- get_context
- impact_analysis
- search_codebase
- repository_stats
- read_symbol_source
- read_file_skeleton
- explore_graph
- shortest_path
- read_file_snippet
- get_edit_context
- find_duplicate_logic

All tools are purely deterministic. There are no OpenAI API calls, semantic search, or embedding-based lookups available.

# Core Philosophy

CodeBroker exists to solve a specific problem:

Finding and understanding the correct code before making changes.

It provides:

* Repository discovery
* Architecture understanding
* Dependency tracing
* Symbol lookup
* Impact analysis
* Context gathering
* Subsystem exploration
* Graph traversal

It does NOT exist to:

* Write code
* Generate patches
* Apply edits
* Rename files
* Create files
* Modify files

CodeBroker should be used to understand.

Native tools should be used to implement.

---

# Default Rule

If the user asks ANY question about the codebase:

* What is this?
* How does this work?
* Where is this implemented?
* What uses this?
* What depends on this?
* Explain this subsystem.
* Find this symbol.
* Find this feature.
* What would break if I change this?

You SHOULD try CodeBroker FIRST for discovery and architecture questions.

Do not guess.

Try CodeBroker before defaulting to grep or recursively scanning directories.

CodeBroker is the repository memory layer, but it is not an absolute ban on native tools when needed.

---

# Verification Rule

You MUST fall back to native tools (like grep or full file reads) to double-check CodeBroker's output in the following scenarios:

1. **Thin or empty dependencies:** If `get_context` or `impact_analysis` returns suspiciously empty or thin dependency results.
2. **Duplicate lists:** If you notice duplicate caller or reverse-dependency lists in the output.
3. **Stale index:** If the index appears stale compared to uncommitted changes or recent native edits you made.
4. **Critical domains:** Anything related to Auth, Payments, or Data-Integrity must be manually verified via native tools before acting on an impact-analysis claim from CodeBroker.

CodeBroker is the repository memory layer.

# Discovery Before Implementation

When the user requests a feature, bug fix, refactor, migration, or modification:

DO NOT immediately start coding.

Instead:

1. Use CodeBroker to discover the relevant files.
2. Use CodeBroker to understand the architecture.
3. Use CodeBroker to identify dependencies.
4. Use CodeBroker to gather edit context.
5. Only after understanding the system should you use native editing tools.

Example:

User:

"I want to add role based permissions."

Correct behavior:

* Discover authentication subsystem.
* Identify related files.
* Analyze dependencies.
* Gather edit context.
* Create implementation plan.
* Then edit code.

Incorrect behavior:

* Start writing code immediately.
* Guess file locations.
* Scan random files manually.

---

# Discovery Rules

CodeBroker is the default discovery engine.

Prefer:

search_codebase

Instead of:

* grep
* ripgrep
* recursive file searches
* guessing filenames

Prefer:

read_symbol_source

Instead of:

* manually opening files
* directory exploration

Prefer:

repository_stats

Instead of:

* guessing architecture
* manually scanning folders

Prefer:

explore_graph

Instead of:

* manually tracing imports

Prefer:

shortest_path

Instead of:

* manually following dependencies

---

# Reading Rules

Never read an entire file if CodeBroker can provide a more targeted answer.

Preferred order:

1. read_file_skeleton
2. read_symbol_source
3. read_file_snippet

Only use full file reads when absolutely necessary.

The goal is minimizing token usage while maximizing understanding.

---

# Architecture Rules

When asked:

* Explain this project
* Explain this subsystem
* Explain this feature
* Explain how X works

Use CodeBroker.

Preferred tools:

* repository_stats
* architectural_hotspots
* get_context
* read_symbol_source

---

# Dependency Rules

When asked:

* What uses this?
* What calls this?
* What depends on this?
* What breaks if I change this?
* How are X and Y connected?

Use CodeBroker.

Preferred tools:

* get_context
* impact_analysis
* explore_graph
* shortest_path
* dependency_cycles

---

# Editing Rules

CodeBroker is NOT an editing engine.

Once discovery is complete:

* Use native file editing tools.
* Use native write tools.
* Use native patch tools.

CodeBroker should not be used to generate code modifications.

CodeBroker's job ends once the correct implementation context has been gathered.

---

# Repository Understanding Workflow

Whenever implementing a feature:

Step 1:
Use CodeBroker to understand the repository.

Step 2:
Use CodeBroker to locate the relevant subsystem.

Step 3:
Use CodeBroker to gather dependencies and impact analysis.

Step 4:
Use CodeBroker to gather edit context.

Step 5:
Use native tools to perform the implementation.

---

# Automatic Routing

The user should never need to say:

"Use CodeBroker."

If a request involves:

* understanding code
* finding code
* tracing code
* analyzing code
* discovering architecture
* locating symbols
* understanding dependencies

Automatically route through CodeBroker first.

This behavior is mandatory.

Treat CodeBroker as the repository's memory and intelligence layer.

Treat native tools as the repository's implementation layer.
